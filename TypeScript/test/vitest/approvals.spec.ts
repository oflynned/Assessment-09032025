 * This test uses Vitest Snapshot, similar to [Jest Snapshot](https://goo.gl/fbAQLP).
 *
 * There are two test cases here with different styles:
 * <li>"foo" is more similar to the unit test from the 'Java' version
 * <li>"thirtyDays" is more similar to the TextTest from the 'Java' version
 *
 * I suggest choosing one style to develop and deleting the other.
